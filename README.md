Hello!

My name is Horacio Rueda. I am a 4th year Ph.D. candidate in Economics at the University of Houston. 

I am interested in market power, labor and international trade. The primary focus of my research is understanding the causes and consequences of imperfect competition on economic aggregates and their distribution.
