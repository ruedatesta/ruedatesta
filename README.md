Hello!

I am an Econ Ph.D. student at the University of Houston. 

My research is mainly focused on answering economic questions with structural models. In doing so, I combine tools from industrial organization, embedded in international trade and macroeconomic models.

I am currently working on two projects:
1. Trade models with variable markups.
2. Labor market, imperfect competition, and bargaining.

The best way to reach me is through email: rhruedar@cougarnet.uh.edu
