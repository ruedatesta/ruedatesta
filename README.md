Hello!

My name is Horacio Rueda. I am an Econ Ph.D. student at the University of Houston. 

My research is mainly focused on understanding the macroeconomic and trade implications of imperfect competition in the market of goods and factors. In doing so, I combine tools from industrial organization.


The best way to reach me is through email: rhruedar@cougarnet.uh.edu
