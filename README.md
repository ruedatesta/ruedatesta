Hello!

My name is Horacio Rueda. I am an Econ Ph.D. student at the University of Houston.

My research is mainly focused on understanding the causes and consequences of imperfect competition on economic aggregates and their distribution. In doing so, I combine tools from industrial organization and network analysis embedded in heterogeneous agents and firm dynamic models.


The best way to reach me is through email: rhruedar@cougarnet.uh.edu
