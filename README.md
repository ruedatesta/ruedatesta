Hello!

I am an Econ Ph.D. student at the University of Houston. 

My research is mainly focused on answering economic questions with structural models in imperfect competition environments.

In doing so, I combine tools from Industrial Organization, International Trade, Macroeconomics, and Political Economy.

I am currently working on two projects:
1. Trade models with two-sided heterogeneous firms.
2. Labor Markets, imperfect competition, and bargaining.

The best way to reach me is through email: rhruedar@cougarnet.uh.edu
